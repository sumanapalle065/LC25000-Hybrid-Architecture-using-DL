# LC25000 Hybrid Architecture using DL
This project explores the LC25000 Lung and Colon Histopathological Dataset.
The goal of the project is to develop a Deep Learning Model architecture to demonstrate an effectiveness of a proposed approach in clinical settings for early 
cancer detection, leading to improved treatment outcomes and reduced mortality rates.
